# This is an example source file for a TipToi file, showing the text-to-speech
# feature

# You write your yaml file as usual:
product-id: 42
welcome: hello
scripts:
  8066:
  - $mode==1? P(mode_one)
  - $mode==2? P(mode_two)
  - $mode==3? P(mode_three)

# But instead of manually creating files hello.ogg, mode_one.ogg and
# mode_two.ogg, you can specify text to be spoken for them.
speak:
  hello:   "Hello!"
  mode_one: "We are in mode one."
  mode_two: "We are in mode two."
  mode_three: "We are in mode three, where I have a little bit more to talk about."

# tttool will write the synthesized files to disk, so that the next execution
# of "tttool assemble" will be quick.
  
# You can mix synthesized and normal files; if there is no entry in the speak
# section, tttool will look for an ogg file as normal.
