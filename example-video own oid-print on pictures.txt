here you can find a short mobile-phone video of my progression on printing onto coloured pictures:

It works very well until a certain degree of brightness.
The darker it gets, the more difficult it becomes for the pen to recognize the code.

But in this picture it works very well on all red-tones, even middle blue tones etc.

For the code, I used 1.200 dpi and arranged the dots (2x2px) in this way: every dot of the left and top line
is 10px away from the next one. 10px space between the dots. This seems to work best.

I will try a couple more things with my way of printing the pictures and codes (paper, brightness, intensity etc.) 
and will inform you guys about the progression.
