# The media path is optional
# The default is "%s", i.e. to look in the current directory
# If you use "example/Buch1_%s", here then P(test) will use
# the file "example/Buch1_test.ogg".
# Ogg files should be Mono, 22050 Hz.
# decode will append .wav or .ogg and uses whatever it finds

# Every register not set is initialized to 0
init: $0:=1

# This is the interesting part: Scripts.
# Technically, this is an assoiative list with the OID as an index,
# and a list of strings as the content
scripts:
  1401:
  - $0==1? $0:=2 $1+=1 P(hello)
  - $0==2? $0+=1 P(one,two,three)
  - $0==3? $0:=1 P(back)
  1402:
  - $1==0?
  - $1==1? P(one)
  - $1==2? P(two)
  - $1==3? P(three)
  - $1!=1? $1 != 2? $1 != 3? $1:=0 P(back)
